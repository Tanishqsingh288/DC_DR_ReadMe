# 🤖 Platinum DC–DR Automation Scope (Boto3 + AWS SDK for Python)

This document defines the complete **automation use cases** that will be implemented using **Boto3** and AWS native SDKs.

Each automation supports one or more of the **core DC–DR objectives**:
1. Uninterrupted Business Operations  
2. Data Integrity and Recovery  
3. Minimal RTO/RPO  
4. Ransomware Resilience  
5. Security and Compliance  
6. Automation and Intelligence

All Boto3 automations will be executed from the **DR Automation Account** (secured via IAM boundaries, cross-account roles, and KMS encryption for secrets).

| **Regional Promotion** | Automatically promote the Aurora Global DB replica in DR to be the new writer after failover. | `rds` | Enables immediate data availability in DR region post failover. |
| **Post-Failover Verification** | After failover, check service readiness in DR (EKS pods running, ALB healthy, DB connection OK). | `eks`, `elbv2`, `rds`, `cloudwatch` | Ensures DR site is fully functional before resuming normal ops. |

### 🧭 Notes
- All automation scripts are modular Python 3.x programs using **Boto3** and **EventBridge** rules for scheduling or triggers.  
- Security-sensitive scripts (like replication guards or failovers) will run with **assumed roles** and **least-privilege IAM policies**.  
- Logs, metrics, and execution reports will be stored in **centralized S3 (Object Lock enabled)** for traceability.  
- Each automation can also be executed manually through **SSM Automation Documents (runbooks)** if human override is needed.
