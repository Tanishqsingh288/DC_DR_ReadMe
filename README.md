# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR) Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR) plan for our company’s production cloud infrastructure.  
The primary goal is to ensure **service availability, resilience, and data protection** for our business-critical Cloud Management Portal (CMP).  
The plan addresses **both common recurring failures** (such as instance crashes or network latency) and **catastrophic failures** (such as full regional outages or ransomware).  

This BCP/DR plan leverages AWS services with a **multi-site (Active-Passive)** disaster recovery strategy, supported by automation, monitoring, and cost-optimized resilience.

## 2. Objectives

### 2.1 Data Center (DC) Objectives
- Maintain high availability of application services across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).  
- Eliminate single points of failure in compute, networking, and database layers.  
- Provide secure, redundant storage for critical business and customer data.  
- Ensure reliable backup and restore mechanisms within the primary data center.  
- Optimize operational costs while retaining resiliency.  

### 2.2 Disaster Recovery (DR) Objectives
- Ensure continuity of services in case of full region outage or catastrophic event.  
- Provide an alternate site (DR Region) with the ability to take over traffic seamlessly.  
- Minimize Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for critical workloads.  
- Replicate backups and databases across regions to ensure data durability.  
- Regularly test failover and recovery procedures to validate effectiveness.  

---

## 3. Scope
This plan covers:  
- The **Cloud Management Portal (CMP)** web application and APIs.  
- Application servers (EC2/VMs) across AWS Availability Zones.  
- Primary Database (Multi-AZ) and its backups.  
- Storage (S3, cross-region replication).  
- DNS and traffic management (Route 53, Load Balancers).  
- Security, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms.

## 4. Risk Assessment

### Common Risks at Production Level
1. **Availability Zone (AZ) failure** → Can cause downtime for single-AZ workloads.  
2. **Regional outage** → Natural disaster or AWS service failure affecting an entire region.  
3. **Database corruption** → Logical or accidental data deletion.  
4. **Ransomware or malware attack** → Data encryption or loss of access.  
5. **Network misconfiguration** → Incorrect security group, VPC, or routing changes leading to outages.  
6. **DDoS attack** → High traffic surge impacting availability.  
7. **Hardware/instance failure** → EC2 or VM crashes leading to downtime.  

These risks must be mitigated through **multi-AZ deployment, multi-site replication, automated backups, monitoring, and proactive security measures**.

## 5. Cloud Architecture for DR & Continuity
- **Primary Region (DC):** Active site serving production traffic with multi-AZ redundancy.  
- **Secondary Region (DR):** Passive site ready to take over in case of regional failure.  
- **Route 53 DNS:** Manages global traffic routing and failover between DC and DR.  
- **Application Layer:** EC2/VMs deployed across 3 AZs per region, behind a load balancer.  
- **Database Layer:** Primary DB with synchronous replication (multi-AZ) and cross-region replication for DR.  
- **Backup Layer:** Automated snapshots and versioned backups in S3, with cross-region replication.  

---

## 6. Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** ≤ 30 minutes for critical services.  
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** ≤ 15 minutes for databases, ≤ 1 hour for backups.  

---

## 7. Disaster Recovery Strategies
Our chosen strategy is **Multi-Site (Active-Passive)**:  
- **Primary Site:** Actively serves traffic under normal operations.  
- **DR Site:** Kept warm and ready to take over in the event of a disaster.  
- **Traffic Routing:** Route 53 automatically fails over to the DR site if the primary region fails.  
- **Data Replication:** Database and backups are replicated across regions using Multi-AZ + Cross-Region Replication.  
- **Validation:** Regular failover drills will be conducted to ensure recovery effectiveness.  

---

## 8. Security & Compliance
- **IAM Policies:** Enforce least-privilege access for automation and users.  
- **Encryption:** Encrypt all data at rest and in transit (KMS, TLS).  
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and CloudTrail for threat detection and auditing.  
- **Network Security:** Security groups, NACLs, and WAF for traffic control and DDoS mitigation.  
- **Compliance:** Adherence to applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001).  

---

## 9. Testing & Validation
- **Simulation of Failures:** Test single-instance failures, AZ outages, and full region failover.  
- **Backup Recovery Tests:** Validate database restore from snapshots and versioned S3 storage.  
- **DR Drills:** Quarterly failover test to DR region to ensure readiness.  

---


## 10. Cost Optimization
- Multi-AZ for critical workloads, single-AZ backups for non-critical.  
- Use S3 lifecycle policies to shift older backups to Glacier.  
- Keep DR Region in **warm standby mode** to reduce cost.  
- Use auto-scaling and spot instances for non-critical environments.  

---

## 11. Estimated Timeframe
- **Working hours:** 5 hrs/day.  
- **Deadline:** 1 month (~20 working days).  

**Phases:**  
1. Requirements & Architecture – 3-4 days.  
2. Terraform & Python Automation – 10-12 days.  
3. Infra Setup & DR Implementation – 5-6 days.  
4. Testing & Validation – 3-4 days.  
5. Documentation & Handover – 2-3 days.
