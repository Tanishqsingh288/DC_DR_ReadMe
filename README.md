# Disaster Recovery (DR) & Site Reliability Plan

## 1. What Are We Doing?  

We are implementing a **comprehensive Disaster Recovery (DR) and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) plan** to ensure that our companyâ€™s cloud infrastructure, web applications, and critical data remain **highly available and resilient** in the face of failures. This plan addresses both **common, recurring failures** (e.g., EC2 instance crashes, storage errors, network latency issues, misconfigured services) and **one-time, catastrophic failures** (e.g., full regional outages, natural disasters, ransomware attacks).  

The strategy includes **redundant infrastructure deployment, automated backups, replication, failover mechanisms, and continuous monitoring**. For multi-cloud readiness, workloads can be replicated to an alternative cloud provider (e.g., Azure or GCP) to maintain business continuity even if one cloud region experiences a total outage.  

**Key focus areas include:**  
- **High Availability:** Distribute services across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and optionally multiple cloud regions.  
- **Data Protection:** Implement automated database snapshots, S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR), and versioned storage.  
- **Automation & Failover:** Use Terraform and Python (Boto3) scripts to automate provisioning, failover, and recovery procedures.  
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Employ AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SNS alerts for rapid detection and response.  
- **Testing & Validation:** Simulate both common failures and catastrophic failures to verify readiness.  
- **Security & Compliance:** Encryption, access controls, auditing, and compliance checks.  
- **Cost Optimization:** Tiered redundancy for critical and non-critical workloads.  

This plan **future-proofs operations**, maintains **customer trust**, ensures **regulatory compliance**, and reduces **downtime and data loss risks** for both everyday and catastrophic failures.

## 2. Why Are We Doing This?  

- **Ensure Service Availability:** Minimize downtime caused by routine and catastrophic failures.  
- **Protect Critical Data:** Safeguard sensitive customer and business data.  
- **Minimize Downtime Costs:** Maintain revenue, customer trust, and brand reputation.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meet legal and industry standards.  
- **Future-Proof Multi-Cloud Readiness:** Prepare for seamless failover across clouds.  
- **Rapid Recovery:** Ensure lost data can be restored quickly, reducing business disruption.

## 3. Business Impact  

- **Revenue Loss:** Downtime directly affects transactions and service delivery.  
- **Customer Trust:** Prolonged outages can erode confidence and loyalty.  
- **Operational Delays:** Critical workflows may halt, affecting internal and external processes.  
- **Compliance Violations:** Data loss or insufficient recovery measures can result in legal penalties.  
- **Reputation Damage:** Frequent or severe failures impact brand credibility.

## 4. Objectives  

### 4.1 DC (Data Continuity) Objectives  
1. Maintain high availability for all critical services.  
2. Ensure automated backups and replication are in place.  
3. Minimize single points of failure in the infrastructure.  
4. Monitor workloads to detect and mitigate common issues proactively.  
5. Ensure security and compliance for all continuously running services.  

### 4.2 DR (Disaster Recovery) Objectives  
1. Enable rapid recovery from catastrophic failures.  
2. Replicate critical workloads across AZs, regions, and optionally clouds.  
3. Automate failover and restoration processes.  
4. Validate readiness through regular testing of extreme failure scenarios.  
5. Minimize business disruption and data loss during major incidents.

## 5. Requirements Before Starting  

- Complete info of existing and upcoming workloads, databases, and dependencies , infrastructure, network topology, and storage architecture.  
- Access to AWS accounts and permissions for automation.  
- Backup policies and data retention requirements.  
- Budget allocation for DR implementation.  
- Regulatory and compliance obligations.  
- Multi-cloud setup readiness (optional but recommended).  

---

## 6. Stack To Be Used  

- **AWS Services:** EC2, RDS/Aurora, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Route 53, DataSync, Step Functions, etc.  
- **Automation & IaC:** Python (Boto3), Terraform.  
- **Optional Multi-Cloud:** Azure VMs, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Compute Engine & Cloud Storage.  

---

## 7. Available Services  

- AWS Backup, CloudFormation, S3 CRR, Aurora Replicas, EC2 Auto Scaling, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Lambda, Step Functions, Route 53 DNS failover.  

---

## 8. Security Aspect  

- IAM roles with least privilege principle for automation scripts.  
- Encryption in transit and at rest for all data.  
- Network security: VPC security groups and ACLs.  
- Logging and auditing via CloudTrail and Config.  
- Compliance checks for regulatory requirements.  

---

## 9. Cost Optimization  

- Critical workloads: fully redundant multi-AZ/multi-region or multi-cloud.  
- Non-critical workloads: cost-efficient single-region backups and snapshots.  
- S3 lifecycle policies to move older backups to Glacier.  
- Auto-scaling and spot instances for non-critical workloads.  

Optional multi-cloud: replicate S3 and RDS data to Azure or GCP for disaster recovery.
